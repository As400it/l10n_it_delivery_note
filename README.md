DDT - Italian Delivery note
===============

This module menage the Italian DDT.
Once the picking is in state done a button will enable the DDT report.
The DDT is for the internal trasfer between wherehouse, outgoing trasfer to client
The sequence is done by the DDT type sequence so is possible to have different
sequence depending on the typology of DDT.

This module is similar to DDT l10n_it_ddt but is easyer(I belive) to used by
warehouse worker. But is not possible to add on the fly product like the DDT
module does.
Also is possible to do a trasfer between different warehouse.

For a correct report layout set the address on warehouse.

next improvment is to add to a picking a ddt sequence of another picking with the
same destnation.

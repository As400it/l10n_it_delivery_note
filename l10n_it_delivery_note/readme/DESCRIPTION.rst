This module manage the Italian DDT.
Once the picking is in state done a button will enable the DDT report.
The DDT is for internal transfers between warehouses, outgoing transfers to customers.
The sequence is done by the DDT type sequence so it's possible to have different
sequence depending on the typology of DDT.

This module is similar to DDT :code:`l10n_it_ddt` but i'ts easier (I believe) to use by
warehouse worker.
Unfortunately it's not possible to add on the fly product like the DDT module does.
It's also possible to do a transfer between different warehouses.

For a correct report layout set the address on warehouse.

Next improvement is to add to a picking a DDT sequence of another picking with the
same destination.


In some situations, user need to add some service charge or some fees on top of what already invoiced.
This module add new feature to "Add Debit Note" from customer invoice / vendor bill
